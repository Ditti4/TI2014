pyr5.c is basically my fifth attempt at writing a program which basically outputs a pyramid of numbers, going from 1 to $number back to 1.

At first I tried to just shove it all into one function which didn't work out very well. Those tries aren't included in here, only the working program is.

Have fun with it. If you find any bugs feel free to either keep or report them. Cheers!
