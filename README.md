Hello there. If you found this you either searched for the smallest repository in the world or you are a member of my study group. In that case I could switch to German, but meh.

Anyway. This repository contains stuff, mainly programming exercises we do in our courses and as homework and I just wanted to have this in a single place so it's easy to look it up.

If you think this repository is missing something (and it's probably always missing something because I'm not good at keeping things up to date) just create a pull request and I'll be happy to merge it.

And some day I will also finally start to comment my code. But of course, if you want to do this for me feel free to do so!
