# TI2014

Hello there. If you found this you either searched for the smallest
repository in the world or you are a member of my study group. In that case I
could switch to German, but meh.

Anyway. This repository contains stuff, mainly programming exercises we do in
our courses and as homework and I just wanted to have this in a single place so
it's easy to look it up.

**Note:** This code is in no way good practice and shouldn't be used in anything
productive. Don't consider my coding style being good at all, expect the worst
and be prepared to be disappointed.

If you think this repository is missing something (and it's probably always
missing something because I'm not good at keeping things up to date) just create
a pull request and I'll be happy to merge it.

And some day I will also finally start to comment my code. But of course, if you
want to do this for me feel free to do so!
